From the beginning, gaedo has always tried to be a good citizen in the Java stack. 

By using maven from the beginning to build our framework, we ensured maximum integration with your project (as how to include gaedo in my application ? explained). 

Today, we go a little further. Indeed, starting today, gaedo will no more be released in its baby pool, but in the olympics water stadium of Sonatype open-source. 

What does it changes for you ? 
------------------------------

Well, a few things. According to Sonatype wiki, there should soon be a synchronization of gaedo with amven central repository. As a consequence, there is no more need for a repository tag for gaedo. And using gaedo in your application will simply require you add the required artifacts.
