GAEDO
=====

Gaedo initially standed for Google App Engine Data Object, but has since evolved into a more generalistic Java persistence layer, supporting

* Google App Engine
* Prevalence
* All graph implementations compatible with Blueprints stack.

Resurected from some lost space on the web, Gaedo documentation is made of a bunch of useful (or not) blog articles _beware_ ! links below only work when file is directly viewed (that's to say not when the file list is visible) :

 1. [the gaedo case][1] where it all begins
 2. [collection storage][5] - only relevant in GAE
 3. [method_missing vs invokeLater][3] explaining some very nice gaedo magic
 4. [Compilable queries][4] or how to use that magic for the good
 5. [dynamic finders the reference][5] for you, crazy (G)Rails punks !

There are other blog articles, but of less interest, unfortunatly
