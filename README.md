GAEDO
=====

Gaedo initiallt standed for Google App Engine Data Object, but has since evolved into a more generalistic Java persistence layer, supporting

* Google App Engine
* Prevalence
* All graph implementations compatible with Blueprints stack.

Resurected from some lost space on the web, Gaedo documentation is made of a bunch of useful (or not) blog articles :

1. [the gaedo case][1] where it all begins
2. [method_missing vs invokeLater][2] explaining some very nice gaedo magic
