GAEDO
=====

Gaedo initially standed for Google App Engine Data Object, but has since evolved into a more generalistic Java persistence layer, supporting

* Google App Engine
* Prevalence
* All graph implementations compatible with Blueprints stack.

Since version 0.3.0, project documentation is available through [GitHub pages][1]. So, for your informations, here are all versions pages (sorted in reverse numeric order) : 

 * [0.4.10][2] release on December 13, 2012, only contains bugfix for [issue #31][3]
 * [0.4.9][4] release on December 12, 2012 (can you imagine cascade flags were never taken in account before ?)
 * [0.4.8][5] release on December 10, 2012 (version 0.4.7 was eaten by a pesky git gremlin)
 * [0.4.6][6] release on December 07, 2012
 * [0.4.5][7] release on December 06, 2012
 * [0.4.4][8] release on December 04, 2012
 * [0.4.3][9] (no 0.4.2 version as git really put my nerves on) (released on November 22, 2012) this release is only a bugfix one, and as a consequence really implies no functionnal change.
 * [0.4.1][10] (released on november 14, 2012)
 * [0.4.0][11] (released on november 8, 2012)
 * [0.3.0][12] (released on october 14, 2012)
